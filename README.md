## Goal
 To further develop my ability to design and improve my coding skills. I tried some new resources to develop this webpage. 
I wanted a webpage that was responsive, attractive and with a great Performance and SEO. The results are quite good but I could improve the 
performance by making all images webp. 

## Use of Spanish
 Apologies for the use of Spanish in file names, labels, comments and the UI of the webpage. I might update all to English, I'm not sure if it's worth the time yet. 
 My Future projects will be in English from the get go.
